# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## 1. Reflection Paper: Understanding Data Representation and Reporting

This document is a reflection on how data was used in a dashboard to analyze and report insights related to customer churn. It explains key elements of data presentation, interaction, and usability for a non-technical audience. The paper outlines various features such as filtering options, color accessibility, and storytelling elements to enhance decision-making for executives.

### Key Sections:
- **Alignment with Data Dictionary**: Discusses how the dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, including churn rates, monthly charges, and bandwidth usage.
- **Enhancing Insights with Additional Data**: Highlights the potential of integrating data from the `internet_session` dataset for deeper analysis of data transfer and its correlation with customer churn.
- **Data Representation for Decision-Making**: Describes maps, box plots, and other visualizations used to identify churn patterns and provide actionable insights.
- **Interactive Controls**: Explains the filters available for exploring data across different geographic levels, such as state or city.
- **Accessibility for Colorblindness**: Details the thoughtful design choices that ensure colorblind users can still interpret the dashboard visuals.
- **Audience Analysis Adaptation**: Explains how the presentation is designed for non-technical executives, with simplified language and clear labels.
- **Effective Storytelling Elements**: Discusses how the churn rate map and box plots help communicate the main factors contributing to churn and potential solutions.

### Source:
- The data used for the analysis is sourced from Western Governor's University's 'Telecommunications Churn' Dataset and Divyanshu Kunwarâ€™s [Internet Usage Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshukunwar/internet-usage-analysis?resource=download) dataset on Kaggle.
